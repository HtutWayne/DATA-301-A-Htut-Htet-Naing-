    "Problem 1: Library Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: Design a program to simulate a library management system. The system should manage books, members, and borrowing/returning actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "Book:\n",
    "Attributes: title (string), author (string), isbn (string), available (boolean)\n",
    "Methods: __init__ (constructor), __str__ (string representation), borrow (sets available to False if available, raises exception otherwise), return_book (sets available to True)\n",
    "Member:\n",
    "Attributes: member_id (integer), name (string), borrowed_books (list of Book objects)\n",
    "Methods: __init__ (constructor), __str__ (string representation), borrow_book (adds a Book object to borrowed_books, calls Book.borrow), return_book (removes a Book object from borrowed_books, calls Book.return_book)\n",
    "Library:\n",
    "Attributes: books (list of Book objects), members (list of Member objects)\n",
    "Methods: __init__ (constructor), add_book, add_member, find_book_by_isbn, find_member_by_id, lend_book (takes member ID and ISBN, finds the book and member, and calls their respective borrow methods), return_book (takes member ID and ISBN, finds the book and member, and calls their respective return methods), display_available_books, display_borrowed_books\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement all the classes and methods described above.\n",
    "The lend_book and return_book methods in the Library class should handle potential errors (e.g., book not found, member not found, book already borrowed). Use exceptions (try-except) appropriately.\n",
    "Provide a simple main function to interact with the library system (add books, add members, lend/return books, display available books, display borrowed books)."
